## Contact Form Setup

The contact form uses Formspree for spam protection and email delivery. The form ID is already configured in the HTML file.

### Current Setup

The form is configured to use Formspree form ID: `mldlrwqy`

### To Change the Form ID

If you want to use a different Formspree form:

1. Go to [Formspree.io](https://formspree.io/) and create a new form
2. Copy your form ID
3. Update the `action` attribute in the form tag in `index.html`:

```html
<form class="contact-form" id="contactForm" action="https://formspree.io/f/YOUR_NEW_FORM_ID" method="POST">
```

### Test the Form

1. Start your local server: `python3 -m http.server 8000`
2. Open `http://localhost:8000`
3. Test the contact form - it should work immediately!
